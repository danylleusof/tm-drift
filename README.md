# TM Drift
TM Drift is an isometric 3D arcade racing game where players race against other players or NPCs for the first place.

The idea of making TM Drift a reality was originated from a merger of two different thoughts. I have always wanted to make a game based on the town of Tanjung Malim. I am also a big fan of racing games. I decided to create a game with a mix of both my passion and desire, and thus TM Drift is born.
